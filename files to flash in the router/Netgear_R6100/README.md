**Note**. These binary files include kmod-dummy package for creating dummy interface for monitoring purpose
          incase you dont have a secondary wireless interface
     but DO NOT INCLUDE the package `ip` `wireless-tools`.

So you can install it with `$opkg update` and `$opkg install ip wireless-tools`.
